# hello-world
My first repository

Hello!

This my first repository, but I am sure that definitively not the last.
I am calling myself as programmer. I have experience in automotive as PLC/HMI programmer.
For about one year I am learing web-developing, especially angularjs, bootstrap etc.
Probably githut is my next step to be professional full-stack developer.

Hope you enjoy my github.

Marcin
